Notes

1) Check for duplicate elements in an array
2) check for negative elements as well
3) check or zero and non zero cases
4) check for Negative infinity and infinity cases as well
5) try to solve in minimum iteration 
7) try to avoid making more variables
8) check for all same elements.
9) for duplicate values and all_same_elements try to reduce the number of operations, 
while making changes check for other cases again....it should not affect other test cases.
9) in while loop condition always remember arry iteration should not be more that array size
10) take care while handling multiple pointers that every iteration or pointer should not be same else it will go to infinite state
